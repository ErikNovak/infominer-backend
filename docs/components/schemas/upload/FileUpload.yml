                  fields type can be based on its suggested type from
                  the [\"Upload a dataset file\"](#/paths/~1datasets/post)
                  route. The type can be anything that is equal to or lower
                  to the recommended type on the following list:

                  - number

                  - datetime

                  - category

                  - class

                  - text


                  **Example:** If the field was suggested the **category**
                  type, it can be any of the **category**, **class**, or
                  **text** types.

                  **Suggestion:** Set the field type to the suggested ones
                  provided by the [\"Upload a dataset file\"](#/paths/~1datasets/post)
                  route.
