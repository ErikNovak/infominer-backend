# Infominer Backend

The (semi-)automatic data exploration and topic ontology creation tool.

## Prerequities

-   NodeJS version 10 or greater

    To test that your nodejs version is correct, run `node --version` in the command line.

-   Docker version 10 or higher, docker-compose v1.23 or higher (required only for setting postgres with docker)
-   Postgres version 10 or greater (required only if one will not spin up a postgres docker container)

## Installation

-   **Install the nodejs dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

-   **Create the `.env` file in the [./env][env] folder and configure it accordingly**

    **NOTE:** If one setup the postgres docker container make sure to use the **TARGET** port
    (see [Database Configuration](#database-configuration)).

## Database Configuration

This repository contains the code used to create the infominer database.
While the advised approach is to create a [postgres docker container][postgres-docker],
one can set up and install the [postgres database][postgres-manual].

1.  **(optional) Start the postgres docker container**

    -   Navigate into the docker folder

        ```bash
        cd ./docker
        ```

    -   Modify the following fields in [docker-compose.yml][docker-compose]:

        -   **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: make sure it is secure

        -   (optional) **ports**: This value sets the mapping/tunnel between the container and system.
            The format is `TARGET:CONTAINER` where **TARGET** is the port number of the system which
            is redirected to the containers port number **CONTAINER**. This will enable the user to
            access the database through the **TARGET** port. If required, modify the **TARGET** port number,
            i.e. `4110`.

    -   Start the containers:

        ```bash
        sudo docker-compose up -d
        ```

        This will start the postgres docker container. One can check if it is running with:

        ```bash
        sudo docker ps
        ```

        The response should be something like this:

        ```bash
        CONTAINER ID  IMAGE        COMMAND                 CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                   NAMES
        52ac627f9966  postgres:13  "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"  5 seconds ago  Up 4 seconds  0.0.0.0:4110->5432/tcp  infominer-db
        ```

    -   (bonus) Stop the containers. This will stop all of the docker containers that are specified in
        `docker-compose.yml` file. Run it only when you do not need the database anymore.

        ```bash
        sudo docker-compose down
        ```

    -   Navigate to the project root

        ```bash
        cd ../
        ```

    **Data Persistence.** The data stored in the postgres database via docker will be persistent.
    The **volumes** configuration are setup so that the database is stored in one of the volumes
    found in **/var/lib/docker/volumes** folder (in this case it will be named `docker_infominer-db`).
    If one would stop the container and run it again it will take the data found in the defined
    volume.

    To remove the persistent volume from the machine, one can follow these steps. **NOTE:** Before following
    the steps make sure to stop the docker container (see previous bonus point).

    1. **Identify the name of the volume.** To get the list of all docker volumes run the following command:

        ```bash
        sudo docker volume ls
        ```

        This will output all of the docker volumes:

        ```bash
        DRIVER  VOLUME NAME
        local   docker_infominer-db
        ```

        The infominer database is named `docker_infominer-db`.

    2. **Delete the docker volume.** To remove the volume run:

        ```bash
        sudo docker volume rm docker_infominer-db
        ```

2.  **Initialize the database tables.** To initialize the table one must simply run the following command:

    ```bash
    node ./load/upgrade
    ```

    This will create the required infominer tables. The table definitions are defined in files found in
    the [./load/postgres][postgres-defs] folder.

3.  **Downgrading the database tables.** To remove all of the database tables simply run the following
    command:

    ```bash
    node ./load/downgrade
    ```

## Start

To start the project run the following command:

```bash
# run in development:watch mode (respawns the service when changes in file happen)
npm run start:watch
# run in development mode
npm start
```

## Build

To build the project run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy

To build and run the service in production mode run the the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If the project is already built one can also start it with:

```bash
node ./dist/server
```

## Clean

During the development process there might appear a lot of temporary files and invalid data bases.
To remove all of the temporary files, data bases, and clean the postgreSQL database, one can run:

```bash
npm run clean
```

**NOTE:** This will make the project as if no-one ever used it.

## PM2

To run Infominer in a more production setting one can use [PM2][pm2], a NodeJS process manager. To install
it simply run

```bash
# install PM2 as a global library
npm install pm2 -g
```

Once the installation is complete, one can configure the [ecosystem.config.yml](./ecosystem.config.yml) file.
Assuming that the project has been built (`npm run build`) one can run the infominer backend in production mode
with the following command:

```bash
pm2 start ecosytem.config.yml
```

This will monitor the project.

# Dockerize

To dockerize infominer one can simply run the following command:

```bash
npm run dockerize
```

This will create a docker image **eriknovak/infominer-backend**. To make your own image, change the
username part of the image name in `package.json`, e.g. **{username}/infominer-backend** of the
**dockerize** script command.

## Start the container using `docker run`

One can manually run the generated docker image. Assuming
the database is running on docker (see [Database Configuration](#database-configuration)), run the
command in the terminal:

```bash
docker run \
    -p 8100:8100 \
    --name infominer-backend \
    --network docker_infominer \
    -e PG_HOST=infominer-db \
    -e PG_PORT=5432 \
    -e PG_USER=postgres \
    -e PG_PASSWORD=password \
    -e PG_DATABASE=infominer \
    -d eriknovak/infominer-backend
```

The above command sets the port mapping, assigns the network in which the docker container will run in and provide
environmental variables to infominer. Lets dissect the above command.

| `-e`         | PG_HOST=infominer-db        | ENV. The PG host is the container name.                                            |
| `-e`         | PG_PORT=5432                | ENV. The PG port on which it is listening.                                         |
| `-e`         | PG_USER=postgres            | ENV. The PG user that will access the database.                                    |
| `-e`         | PG_PASSWORD=password        | ENV. The PG user password.                                                         |
| `-e`         | PG_DATABASE=infominer       | ENV. The PG database.                                                              |
| `-d`         | eriknovak/infominer-backend | Run the container in detach mode (running in the background).                      |
